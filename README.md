## General Info
TechNewz is a blog type website built entirely with HTML and CSS.
## Technologies
Project is created with:
- HTML
- CSS
## How I worked on this project
My goal was to simulate a professional work environment:
- I built this app based on blog website designs.
- I worked with tasks on my personal to do list that i created.
## How to navigate on this project
This website uses links to go from page to page.
## Why I built the project this way
I decided to build the entire site from scratch in order for me to practice efficiently my HTML and CSS.
I also refrained from using third party libraries in order to get a handle especially on CSS. This enabled me to learn website responsiveness and how to create a good UI.
## If I had more time i would change this
- Create more precise commits
- Create branches and use pull requests to generate a good workflow
- Use Trello to handle my tasks during development
- Use an API in order to get dynamic blog data instead of hard coding it.
- Implement User Authentication and Create User accounts
- Create an Algorithm that recommends blogs depending on the User's taste.
